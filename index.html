			<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Currency is the medium of exchange. Money related transactions are an important part of our day to day lives. Along with technology the banking sector is also getting modern and being explored. Despite the widespread usage of ATMs, Credit, Debit Cards, and other digital modes of payment like as Google Pay, Paytm, and Phone Pay, money is still widely used for most daily transactions due to its convenience.</li>
				<li>Currency recognition or bank-note recognition is a process of identifying the denominational value of a currency. It is a simple and straightforward task for the normal human beings, but if we consider the visually challenged people currency recognition is a challenging task. Visually handicapped people have a difficult time distinguishing between different cash denominations. Even though unique symbols are embossed on different currencies in India, the task is still too difficult and time-consuming for the blind.</li>
				<li>Keywords: - Currency recognition, visually disabled, SIFT, ORB, FAST, SURF, Denomination, Image Processing, Feature Extraction, Pre-Processing, Edge Detection, Image comparison.</li>

			<h2> &copy; PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
			<p>Post demonetization, the sizes of the Indian currency notes have drastically changed. For example, the new Rs.100and Rs.200 notes similar physical dimensions. Though the colour of such notes is very contrasting, this difference is beneficial only to those blessed with eyesight. The population of the visually challenged in India is a staggering 36 million. These people have a hard time identifying these new notes (even the Braille and small dots and holes on these notes seem to fade away with prolonged usage). This project aims to relieve some of their problems using assistive technology.

			<h2> &copy; PROBLEM OBJECTIVES</h2>
<p>Visually Impaired are those people who have vision impairment or vision loss. Problems faced by visually impaired in performing daily activities are in great number. They also face a lot of difficulties in monetary transactions. They are unable to recognize the paper currencies due to similarity of paper texture and size between different categories. This money detector app helps visually impaired patients to recognize and detect money. </p></section>
